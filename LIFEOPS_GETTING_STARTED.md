## What is Life Operations?

Think of Life Operations as your personal life assistant - it watches, learns, and helps you understand yourself better.

### The Simple Version

Life Operations does three things:

1. **Tracks your life** - Sleep, activity, health, and daily routines
2. **Finds patterns** - Discovers what helps or hurts your wellbeing
3. **Gives insights** - Tells you what it all means in simple English

### Why You'd Want This

**Have you ever wondered...**

- "Why am I always tired on Mondays?"
- "When am I most productive?"
- "Does my sleep really affect my mood?"
- "Am I getting enough exercise?"
- "What's causing my stress?"

Life Operations answers these questions automatically. No spreadsheets, no manual tracking - it just works.

**Setup time:** 5 minutes

**How to connect:**
1. Open Life Operations
2. Go to Settings → Connections
3. Click "Connect Fitbit"
4. Log in to your Fitbit account
5. Done! Data starts flowing automatically

#### Option 2: Smart Home Cameras
**What you need:** Home security cameras (Roku, Ring, etc.)

**What you get:** Activity tracking at home, safety monitoring, routine detection

**Setup time:** 10 minutes

**How to connect:**
1. Make sure cameras are on your home network
2. Open Life Operations
3. Go to Settings → Cameras
4. Add camera (it will scan your network)
5. Choose what to monitor (privacy-friendly - no recordings stored)

#### Option 3: Manual Tracking

## Understanding Your Insights

### What Are Patterns?

Patterns are connections Life Operations finds in your data. There are four types:

#### 1. Habits (Things You Do Regularly)
**Example:** "You wake up at 7:15am ±20 minutes every weekday"

**Why it matters:** Understanding your habits helps you work with them, not against them.

**What you can do:** Schedule important tasks around your natural habits.

#### 2. Correlations (Things That Connect)
**Example:** "When you exercise in the morning, you sleep 30% better that night"

**Why it matters:** Shows cause and effect in your life.

**What you can do:** Do more of what helps, less of what hurts.

#### 3. Trends (Things Changing Over Time)
**Example:** "Your activity has decreased 15% over the last month"

**Why it matters:** Catch issues before they become problems.

**What you can do:** Course-correct early.

#### 4. Anomalies (Unusual Events)
**Example:** "You only slept 4 hours last night - that's 3 hours below your average"

**Why it matters:** Highlights things that need attention.

**What you can do:** Investigate and address unusual events.

### Confidence Levels

Each insight has a confidence level:

**High Confidence (★★★★★)**
- Based on lots of data
- Consistent pattern
- Very likely accurate
- Act on these

**Medium Confidence (★★★☆☆)**
- Based on some data
- Pattern emerging
- Probably accurate
- Worth watching

**Low Confidence (★☆☆☆☆)**
- Limited data
- Possible pattern
- Might be random
- Don't act yet, just note it

### Real Insight Examples

#### Sleep Insight
> **Pattern Found**  
> **Confidence:** ★★★★★  
> **Type:** Correlation  
> 
> When you go to bed before 11pm, you sleep 45 minutes longer and report better mood the next day. This has been true for 23 out of 25 nights tracked.
>
> **Recommendation:** Set a 10:30pm bedtime reminder.

#### Productivity Insight
> **Pattern Found**  
> **Confidence:** ★★★★☆  
> **Type:** Habit  
>
> You're most productive between 10am-12pm. Your focus is 60% higher during this window compared to afternoons.
>
> **Recommendation:** Schedule important work during your peak hours.

#### Health Insight
> **Pattern Found**  
> **Confidence:** ★★★☆☆  
> **Type:** Trend

## Common Questions

### "How much do I need to track?"

**Minimum:** Sleep (7+ nights)  
**Good:** Sleep + Activity (2 weeks)  
**Best:** Multiple sources (1 month)

The more data, the better insights. But you'll start seeing value after just one week of basic tracking.

### "Is my data private?"

**Yes.** Your data stays on your device/local network. Nothing is shared unless you explicitly choose to.

**What's stored locally:**
- All your life events
- Patterns discovered
- Your queries and results

**What uses cloud services (optional):**
- AI analysis (uses OpenAI/Google, you can disable)
- Cloud backup (optional)

**You control:**
- What's tracked
- What's analyzed
- What's stored
- What's shared

### "What if I miss a day?"

**No problem!** Life Operations works with whatever data you have. Missing days just mean:
- Fewer insights for that period
- No impact on other patterns
- Can always fill in manually if you want

### "Can I track custom things?"

**Absolutely!** Track anything:

**Examples:**
- Medication taken
- Mood ratings
- Meals and diet
- Work sessions
- Meditation
- Symptoms
- Anything else

**How:**
1. Open Sophia
2. Click "Add Event"
3. Choose "Custom"
4. Name it and add details
5. Life Operations starts tracking it

### "Will it nag me?"

**Only if you want it to.**

Default mode: Gentle reminders and helpful insights

**You can adjust:**
- Frequency (daily, weekly, never)
- Urgency (only important vs. everything)
- Type (health only, patterns only, everything)
- Timing (morning, evening, don't disturb hours)

**Settings → Notifications → Customize**

### "What if I don't like an insight?"

**Three options:**

1. **Dismiss it** - "Not helpful" button
2. **Provide feedback** - Tell Sophia why it's wrong
3. **Adjust sensitivity** - Settings → Insights → Threshold

Life Operations learns what you find helpful and adjusts.

### "Can multiple people use it?"

**Yes!** Each person gets their own profile.

**How it works:**
- Each person logs in with their account
- Data is completely separate
- No cross-contamination
- Privacy maintained

**Great for:**
- Couples tracking together
- Family health monitoring
- Roommate house management
